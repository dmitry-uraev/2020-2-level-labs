I have a cat. 
His name is Tom.
He is orange in colour.
His body is covered with bushy orange fur.
He has four legs and two beautiful eyes.
He has a long tail. 
He likes to eat fish and play with the ball.
He fetches the ball and plays with me all day long.
He can also run very fast. He doesn't like to sleep during the night.
My cat is the best cat one can ever have.
I love my cat very much.
